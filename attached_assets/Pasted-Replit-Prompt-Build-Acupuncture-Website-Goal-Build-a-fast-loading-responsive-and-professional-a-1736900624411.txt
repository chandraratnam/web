Replit Prompt: Build Acupuncture Website

Goal: Build a fast-loading, responsive, and professional acupuncture website with a warm, appealing color scheme. The design should convey authority while being visually appealing and persuasive enough to encourage bookings.

Design and Structure
	1.	Homepage Title and Subheading:
	•	Title: “Experience Rapid Natural Healing through Personalised Acupuncture.”
	•	Subheading: “Restore balance and vitality to your life with our expertly tailored treatments. We systematically combine ancient wisdom with modern expertise for optimal wellness.”
	•	No hero image on the homepage.
	2.	Call-to-Action Buttons:
	•	Include a “Book Appointment” button directly under the subheading on the homepage.
	•	Add a “Book Appointment” button in both the header and footer for easy access.
	•	Buttons should be a friendly green color (e.g., #5cb85c) that stands out prominently on the site and links to:
https://central-coast-body-mechanics.au1.cliniko.com/bookings?business_id=59092&practitioner_id=158654#service.
	3.	Color Scheme:
	•	Use warm, earthy tones (beige, soft greens, light browns) to create a calming and professional aesthetic.
	•	Ensure the green buttons serve as clear calls-to-action and stand out.
	4.	Service Section:
	•	Create 4 boxes on the homepage to showcase services:
	•	Pain Management: Brief blurb like “Relieve chronic and acute pain through targeted treatments.”
	•	Stress and Anxiety: Blurb like “Regain calm and focus with relaxing therapies.”
	•	Women’s Health: Blurb like “Address hormonal imbalances and fertility concerns naturally.”
	•	Digestive Health: Blurb like “Improve digestion and gut health with personalized care.”
	•	Each box should include an appropriate image downloaded and linked locally.
	5.	Footer:
	•	Display the following text:
Dave Chandraratnam – Professional acupuncture and Chinese medicine services in East Gosford, NSW. Extensive experience in treating various conditions with a systematic approach.
	•	Include a Contact Section:

Contact  
Dave can be found practising at:  
37 Althorp Street , East Gosford, NSW 2250  
(02) 4325 5448  
dave@curatedhealth.com.au  


	•	Add a Book Appointment button in the footer as well.

	6.	Smooth Scrolling:
	•	Use smooth scrolling animations for navigation links and anchors (e.g., the “Contact” link in the header scrolling down to the footer).

Additional Pages
	1.	What I Treat Page:
	•	Content should be taken from:
https://chandraratnam.com/what-i-treat/index.html
	•	Reformat the content for readability and ensure it loads well on mobile.
	2.	FAQ Page:
	•	Content should be taken from:
https://chandraratnam.com/faq/index.html
	•	Reformat the content for clarity and optimize it for mobile usability.
	3.	Blog:
	•	Add functionality for a blog but do not include links to it on the homepage or header initially.
	•	Blog entries should be simple and include the ability to embed images or videos.

Technical and Functional Requirements
	1.	Performance Optimization:
	•	Compress all images and text for faster load times, particularly on slow mobile connections.
	•	Minimize JavaScript usage to reduce load time and improve deployment efficiency.
	•	Ensure smooth scrolling animations are lightweight and do not impact performance.
	2.	Google Analytics Integration:
	•	Include a shared file for Google Analytics setup (e.g., analytics.js) that can be referenced across all pages.
	3.	SEO Optimization:
	•	Target local SEO for the Central Coast of NSW, using keywords like “Acupuncture East Gosford,” “Pain Management Central Coast,” etc.
	•	Add structured data (schema markup) for local businesses to improve search visibility.
	4.	Responsive Design:
	•	Ensure the website looks and functions perfectly across all devices, especially mobile phones.
	•	Implement responsive layouts for services and contact sections.
	5.	Readme File:
	•	Create a README.md file to:
	•	Explain the file structure.
	•	Provide instructions for adding blog entries, static assets, and updates to content/pages.
	•	Describe where and how to add/edit Google Analytics.
	•	Include tips for improving SEO (e.g., meta descriptions, alt tags for images).

What to Avoid
	1.	No contact form.
	2.	No testimonials.
	3.	No carousels.
	4.	Avoid excessive animations or transitions that could slow down the site.

Additional Notes
	•	The header should include:
	•	“Dave Chandraratnam” on the left.
	•	Navigation links (What I Treat, FAQ, Contact) on the right.
	•	The Contact link should scroll down to the footer.
	•	The website should be built to support deployment on static hosting platforms like Netlify or similar.
